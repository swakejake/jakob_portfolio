# jakob_portfolio

# This is a portfolio for Jakob Andersson, where I show off my very basic projects I've done in my journey to become a developer.

 Currently my main focus of area is taking myself through The Odin Project, where I am just about to start the journey on more advanced Javascript.

 My previous experience is a couple of uni courses, with Basic HTML, CSS and Javascript, and some Udemy Courses.

 My working experience is solely within SEO, where I learned most of the basic concepts of the importance of good structured code, and how fun it actually is.
