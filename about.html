                My name is Jakob, and I come from Sollefte√•. When I grew up I was a total sports nerd, and kinda am

                My journey of becoming a developer started when I first got in contact with SEO, way back when WebSpell
                was
                an eSports CMS used widely over the Cod4 community. I realized it was fun, but I kinda enjoyed doing the
                basic SEO, white-page stuff more than actual coding. Fast forward a few years I land my first Tech Job
                at
                Grow Me Group. Here I worked with SEO and PPC as a consultant. This then was followed by a quick detour
                to
                study Interactive Media and Web Development, but I got a new job and dropped out of school.

                <br>
                That was my closest thing to ever actually studying anything remotely close to coding. Then I got
                another
                SEO job, as a specialist at Brath. This is actually wHere I got the love for technical SEO and all that
                jazz,
                and I could mix my knowledge in SEO and still work a little bit with JavaScript and coding in general.

                <h3>Actual skill</h3>
                Right now, my coding skills are sub-par. But I do really enjoy the whole process of troubleshooting, and
                I've started to get a grasp on how to actually do some proper googling for my problems that I face on
                the road. I really enjoy working with code and that shows, because I can really spend hours doing
                something without realizing the time I've actually spent. I also believe that my knowledge by reading
                code, and understanding what functions do, is a lot "higher" than my typing skills.
