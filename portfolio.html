        <div class="content">This game was the final task to create a javascript game where the user is suppose to score
            as many points as possible. The assignment was to create the Javascript file needed, and we were provided
            with CSS and HTML. It took me about 2 weeks time of work, with a lot of problem solving and questioning my
            abilities to create anything. <br>
            My biggest struggle was to get the drag and drop to work. When that clicked, it went pretty smooth. The game
            makes use of cookies so that the user can leave and return to play the game with the score and total games
            played previously.

        <div class="img-con"><img src="/img/pensionat_js.jpg" alt="Javascript Calculation"></div>
        <div class="content">This app was created to learn how to use ints and numbers while doing basic math. It's a
            program to calculate costs for an overnight stay at a motel. You can add addons, such as internet, parking
            and a special view which will affect the total price.
            <br>
            At this link, there are also 2 other applications created as homework. One is controlling the DOM, where you
            drive a car to hit warthogs. <br>
            The other application is to match the correct image with the correct city, to score as many points as
            possible. These 3 apps together was the fondation for the Javascript game above. View it <a href="https://stupefied-mayer-dbc766.netlify.app/">here</a> and press the labb you want to test out. Labb 4 is match the city, Labb 5 is hit the warthogs, and Labb 6 is the motel calculator.

        <div class="content">Etch a Sketch - This project is something I've made during the process of going through The Odin Project. It's been a wierd journey, where I feel like i understand parts of the development, but not all parts. So coming up to this project, I thought it would be easy. It was harder than expected, but I learned how to use a more fresh way of Javascript, and it was such a "ball" drop when I figured it out.
